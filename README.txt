This is a group project submission for Tim Izzard, Summer Kearney, and Mike Lynch for section 2 of INFO5060.

Note:
The config is set so that only the Client project "WordleGameClient" rebuilds on startup. 
This was to address a bug where the client project was terminating the servers.

Please build the following projects individually:
WordleGameClient
WordleGameServer
WordServer
